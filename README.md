# The Space Traffic Management Ontology (STMO) and Knowledge Graph
An ontology of space traffic coordination and management (STC/STM)

## Description
_See also the Ontology Requirements Specification Document (purchase link coming soon)._

### Scope
This is an ontology about space traffic management and coordination. The concept of STM and STC is evolving, but is approximately similar to that of air or marine traffic management. It represents a higher-order organization construct in society that potentially fuses distinct services and activities in one or more spare-faring societies. As such it depends on some fundamental activities and interactions between actors. It is needed, if not emergent, when those actors and activities reach a certain if imprecise degree of complexity. In other words, when the interaction and traffic flow of actors and technological systems reach a certain complexity a structuring or organizing concept and action is needed to ensure order and sustinability among them, i.e., that of STM. Thus, STM brings in the activities and goals of SSA, cooperative and coordinative activity, communications, policy, etc.

### Purpose
* To formally represent target content and concept
* To support safe and sustainably spaceflight by providing computable terminologies and conceptual models for various applications
* ...  

### Status
* In-progress as circumstances permit. Subject to revision. 
* As a unfunded personal project since inception, continued development is dependent on circumstances. Formal support is needed to complete and sustain development to realize the full project vision. The vision is ambitious, multidisciplinary and detailed. [Contact the author](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) to formally support the project in some way. Donations are welcome at the below web-links.  
* ACTIVELY NEEDING: financial support, employer support, stable environment with resources to development and continue learning, etc.
* Desired as my PhD or other graduate project
