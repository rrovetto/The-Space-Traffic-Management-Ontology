# The Space Traffic Management Ontology (STMO) and Knowledge Graph
An ontology of space traffic coordination/management (STC/STM)

## About
This is an ontology about space traffic management (STM). The concept of STM (and space traffic coordination) is evolving, but is approximately similar to that of air or marine traffic management. It represents a higher-order organization construct in society that potentially fuses distinct services and activities in one or more spare-faring societies. As such it depends on some fundamental activities and interactions between actors. It is needed, if not emergent, when those actors and activities reach a certain imprecise degree of complexity. In other words, when the interaction and traffic flow of actors and technological systems reach a certain complexity a structuring or organizing concept and action is needed to ensure order and sustinability among them, i.e., that of STM. Thus, STM brings in the activities and goals of SSA, cooperative and coordinative activity, communications, policy, etc.
